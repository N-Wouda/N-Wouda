### Hi, I'm Niels! ðŸ‘‹

I like to write software tools that help humans make better decisions. I am finishing up my PhD (in Operations Research) and am looking for work. If you have an optimisation problem related to routing, dispatch, and/or e-commerce, I would love to hear about it! My preferred role would be something where I get to write nice code to solve business problems using combinatorial optimisation - mathematical programming, heuristics, simulation, and so on. My ideal stack would combine Python and C++, but I'm pretty flexible on the technology.
